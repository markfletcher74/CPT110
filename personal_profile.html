You like to see what you are learning.<br><br>As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.<br><br>Here are some things that visual learners like you can do to learn better:
								<ul>
									<li>Sit near the front of the classroom. (It won't mean you're the teacher's pet!)</li>
									<li>Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis.</li>
									<li>Use flashcards to learn new words.</li>
									<li>Try to visualize things that you hear or things that are read to you.</li>
									<li>Write down key words, ideas, or instructions.</li>
									<li>Draw pictures to help explain new concepts and then explain the pictures.</li>
									<li>Color code things.</li>
									<li>Avoid distractions during study times.</li>

								<td valign="top"><small><i><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b>
								<br>
								The results show that I am adaptable to change and that I can relate well to others which is essential for team cohesion and harmony within a group.  I learn best through visual aids, so will respond well to being shown ideas, presentations etc. rather than just being talked to.  The low creativity score is typical for someone with an engineering mindset over that of an artistic one so I'm not really surprised!
								<br><br><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b>
								<br>As mentioned before, the results show that I will bring little or no conflict to a team since my focus is on ensuring the team is getting along and I prefer to focus on the task at hand rather than politics within a group.  The creativity score tells me that I wouldn't offer much in the way of creative input although I have been quite innovative in previous challenges within the workplace with regard to automation and process improvements.
								<br><br><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b>
								<br>I would fit best into a group that already has lots of good ideas regardless of complexity but is having difficulty realising them or in a group of individuals that is unfamiliar with group work.  </i></small></td>
