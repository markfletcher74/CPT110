The Andes Mountains<sup>6</sup> run along the Eastern Border of the country.  Chile also owns Easter Island - a small outpost off the coast of Chile where the Maui figures stand (big heads carved out of stone), although the origins of which still remain a mystery to this very day.</small></td>

												<br><b><i>ASI Technologies Born (May 2001)</i></b><br><small>After leaving Ericssons (<a href="../resume/resume.html">see resume</a>) I decided to set up my own company "ASI Technologies" - I provided IT related services to people and businesses alike.  I had a steady stream of clients and I am proud to say that large companies such as Thomas Cook, EDS and the County Council all called upon my services.  Upon my departure to Australia, I wound the business down - although only in business for a short time, I am glad I had the experience.</small><br>
												<br><b><i>The Millennium (January 1,2000)</i></b><br><small>Y2K - what a non-event eh?  Well not so for myself and others in my industry - unless you were asleep, comatose or dead you would've heard about the 'Millennium Bug'.  Primarily associated with older computers not being able to cope with the turning of the clock at midnight, January 1 2000 it kept IT individuals busy in preparation.  Most of it involved replacing old hardware.  Although 99% of the population saw the Y2K/Millenium Bug as a non-starter, I view it differently ; because of the efforts of the IT personnel around the globe, problems were minimised and/or eliminated.  Would people have preferred it if computer systems stopped working then??? :)</small>
